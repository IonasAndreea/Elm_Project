{-| Given two `Date`s it returns the number of months between the two dates as an **absolute** value.

  - Otherwise the result is undefined (`Nothing`)

First, dates are compared by the year field. If it's equal, the month fields are used as follows:

  - Otherwise the date without month is greater
